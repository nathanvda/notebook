# Notebook

This is a small demo application, to mimic the functionality of Google Notebook.
There are currently some alternatives available, but none had that same simplicity from the google one that I like.

# To Do

* use a good editor solution
* allow to delete notes (use a small x)
* allow to reorder notes
* notes are by default ordered descending by date
* import google notebook
* markdown
* show a small data + allow option to add tags to a note or book
* search on content or tags
* do a better layout ...
* provide a trashcan ... (restore/delete for real)

* dashboard: show some stats?


# Planned features

* start with a simple frontend
* progress to a single page solution, using backbone-rails or sproutcore?
* use bootstrap for styling?
