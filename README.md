# Notebook

This is a small demo application, to mimic the functionality of Google Notebook.
I currently still use that, while it is no longer supported by Google.
There are currently some alternatives available, but none had that same simplicity from the google one that I like.

# To Do

* use vigilante for safety
* edit/manage own profile
* manage trash
* switch to using ActiveRecord session store (see initializers/session-store for more info)

* allow to reorder notes
* import google notebook
* markdown
* show a small date + allow option to add tags to a note or book
* search on content or tags
* do a better layout ...
* provide a trashcan ... (restore/delete for real)

* dashboard: show some stats?
