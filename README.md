# Notebook

This is a small demo application, to mimic the functionality of Google Notebook.
I currently still use that, while it is no longer supported by Google.
There are currently some alternatives available, but none had that same simplicity from the google one that I like.

# Planned features

* start with a simple frontend
* progress to a single page solution, using backbone-rails or sproutcore?
* use bootstrap for styling?
